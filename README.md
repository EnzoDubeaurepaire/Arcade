# Arcade

## 📖 Description

**Arcade** is a modular arcade game engine developed as a one-month project at **Epitech**, in a team of three.  
The goal was to create a game framework capable of dynamically loading both **games** and **graphic libraries** at runtime, allowing the user to switch between them while the program is running.

The project was also designed to encourage cross-group collaboration by making it possible to exchange either a **display module** or a **game module** with another group's project.

A detailed documentation explaining how to develop and integrate a new **game** or **graphic library** is available in the `/doc` folder.
